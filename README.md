# eCommerce Data Science 

## Overview

This project contains an analysis of an eCommerce transactions dataset. The dataset includes details about customers, products, and transactions. The objective is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), build a Lookalike Model, and perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

### Dataset Includes:
- **Customers**: CustomerID, Region, SignupDate, etc.
- **Products**: ProductID, Category, Price, etc.
- **Transactions**: TransactionID, Quantity, TotalValue, etc.

# 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights

## Overview

This task involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the eCommerce transactions dataset. The goal is to analyze and understand the dataset, uncover patterns, and generate actionable business insights based on customer and transaction data.

EDA will include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Statistical analysis of customers, products, and transactions.
- Identifying trends, correlations, and anomalies in the data.

Business insights derived from the EDA will help inform decisions in marketing, sales, and customer targeting.

## Files

- **FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for EDA and analysis.
- **FirstName_LastName_EDA.pdf**: PDF report summarizing the key insights and findings from the EDA.

## Steps to Run the EDA Notebook

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name


# 2. Lookalike Model: Customer Recommendations

## Overview

This task builds a **Lookalike Model** to recommend the top 3 similar customers for each customer based on their profile and transaction history. The model uses both customer and product information, and assigns a similarity score to each recommended customer.

## Files

- **FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the Lookalike Model.
- **FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv**: CSV file containing customer recommendations (CustomerID, Top 3 Lookalikes, and similarity scores).

## Steps to Run the Lookalike Model Notebook

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   

# 3. Customer Segmentation Using Clustering

## Overview

This task involves segmenting customers into distinct clusters based on their profiles and transaction data. The segmentation aims to identify customer groups for targeted marketing strategies. Various clustering techniques are applied, and the clusters are evaluated using clustering metrics such as the **DB Index**.

The clustering process will combine customer demographic information (from the `Customers.csv` file) with their transaction behavior (from the `Transactions.csv` file) to form meaningful customer segments.

## Files

- **FirstName_LastName_Clustering.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook implementing the clustering techniques for customer segmentation.
- **FirstName_LastName_Clustering.csv**: CSV file listing the customer IDs along with their assigned clusters.
- **FirstName_LastName_Clustering_Report.pdf**: PDF report summarizing the clustering results, insights, and the evaluation of clustering metrics.

## Steps to Run the Clustering Notebook

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
